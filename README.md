App name: Track Pulse - Run stat tracking

App description: This app provides a user authenticated environment where the user can log into their accout to add and manage runs. The user can add their run including infomration such as distance, duration, and any additional notes. This run can then be edited, updated or deleted. The user can the view their runs to see how they are progressing in their training. 

Reason for app: I have recently signed up for a half marathon and when tasked witha a tracking app this automatically seemed viable. I liked the idea that a runner could have a dedicated space to view and compare their training runs.

Notes from the GA unit 4 course were vital in building the app (https://generalassembly.instructure.com/login/canvas). In particular the Cat Collector demo project. <br>
https://stackoverflow.com/ I used stack overflow to research how to alter the media viewing of the nav bar - to change to vertical alignment. <br>

Technologies used: JavaScript, Django, SQL, HTML, CSS <br>

Next steps:

- I would like to build in a way to visualize the data, maybe as a graph over time, so the user could visually see improvements.
- I would like to be able to build other activites into the app so the user could add other sports, rather than just running.
- I would like to be able to build in a search function, so that the user could search effectivily through their posts, for exapmle if they wanted to compare all of the 5km runs thay had completed.
